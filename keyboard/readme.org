* flashing through qmk
     - clone the QMK source
     - follow the setup instructions on wiki
     - left hand
       - sudo make ergodox_infinity:josiah MASTER=left
       - sudo make ergodox_infinity:josiah:dfu-util MASTER=left
     - right hand
       - sudo make ergodox_infinity:josiah MASTER=right
       - sudo make ergodox_infinity:josiah:dfu-util MASTER=right 

     - leds only work on the left side, not the right. confused.
* flashing old kii firmware mechanism
  - i don't rightly understand what's going on here, but /this/ firmware seems to make LEDs work on both halves.
  - they must have updated something in the firmware that doesn't work with older ergodox infinity models, which is pretty annoying.
  - i'm keeping this shit around for the time being. other than the LED/LCD thing there's no real reason to keep this.

  - flash like:
    - sudo dfu-util -D left_kiibohd.dfu.bin
