2019-07-05 13:55:38	f0xtr0t	Hi! How do I run (process-lines "foobar") and get it to run foobar on the server that I'm connected to via tramp? process-lines seems to only do things on the local machine.
2019-07-05 13:57:53	johnjay	parsnip: i guess that makes sense
2019-07-05 13:58:11	johnjay	maybe i'm confused because i th ink it should be part of a larger framework or something
2019-07-05 13:58:15	npostavs	f0xtr0t: you'll need to use process-file instead (it's the file-handler enabled version of call-process)
2019-07-05 13:58:19	johnjay	like a code-generation library for java
2019-07-05 13:58:44	parsnip	not all languages have a magic ecosystem
2019-07-05 13:59:04	parsnip	and this is a lightweight solution
2019-07-05 13:59:16	parsnip	sometimes magic ecosystems crash cheap computers
2019-07-05 13:59:18	johnjay	well ok but what if you needed to change $1 by adding a letter to it at some point?
2019-07-05 13:59:22	johnjay	would you just use regexp?
2019-07-05 13:59:44	parsnip	the usual emacs way
2019-07-05 13:59:48	parsnip	whatever works for you
2019-07-05 13:59:55	parsnip	you mean code refactoring, i guess
2019-07-05 14:00:04	parsnip	that's a different question
2019-07-05 14:00:22	parsnip	but i guess you file it under, "i'm used magic ecosystems"
2019-07-05 14:00:22	johnjay	sure
2019-07-05 14:00:25	parsnip	*used to
2019-07-05 14:00:53	parsnip	some languages work better in an IDE
2019-07-05 14:01:01	johnjay	also does yas have more features than that?
2019-07-05 14:01:14	parsnip	more features than what?
2019-07-05 14:01:17	parsnip	like what?
2019-07-05 14:01:25	johnjay	i mean it's basically regex substituting into a string right?
2019-07-05 14:01:29	johnjay	why not do that by hand?
2019-07-05 14:01:52	f0xtr0t	npostavs: Thanks! That helps a lot! :)
2019-07-05 14:02:10	f0xtr0t	Finally I've got this script working as I wanted :)
2019-07-05 14:02:23	parsnip	johnjay: so by hand, you want to insert that block and do a regex substitute?
2019-07-05 14:02:44	parsnip	johnjay: i think you mean, "pfft, that package is small and is not complicated, what a bunch of amateurs"
2019-07-05 14:03:02	parsnip	you don't have to use it
2019-07-05 14:03:21	johnjay	i'm trying to figure out why i would want to use it
2019-07-05 14:03:31	johnjay	i guess i can try using it and see
2019-07-05 14:04:03	parsnip	i didn't use it until those particularly large annoying blocks i showed you
2019-07-05 14:04:21	parsnip	i've been writing them manually for a while, because why bother setting up yasnippet
2019-07-05 14:04:38	parsnip	and maintaining snippets, etc
2019-07-05 14:04:56	parsnip	(i don't want to maintain the snippets, i'll be submitting a PR soon)

2019-07-05 15:07:49	TreyHarris	I've been using it a long time, so those two particular snippets are a bit of a mess of old and new features and not designed for readability; they could be improved without any loss of functionality

2019-07-08 12:52:30	unknownmosquito	strangely the Ubuntu 19.04 Gnome uses X11
2019-07-08 12:52:39	fledermaus	as to the argumets, there are definitely some infelicities in the X protocol to do with things like synchronising rendering events (basically guaranteeing that certain things happen at once, or at least not before certain other events)

2019-07-08 12:55:07	fledermaus	unknownmosquito: Ididn't say they _couldn't_ - the decision was that they would go with the default for gnome when gnome was in use, and it is the default desktop env, so. Ubuntu's decisions belong to ubuntu, not to debian.
2019-07-08 12:55:44	unknownmosquito	oh yeah fledermaus I just thought it was interesting that Ubuntu had shipped Gnome in a non-default setting. AFAIK the other Gnome-default distributions are shipping Wayland now.

2019-07-08 15:46:59	wasamasa	nope
2019-07-08 15:47:02	MoziM	no?
2019-07-08 15:47:04	turbofail	hmmmm that term usually means something else
2019-07-08 15:47:05	 *	MoziM pondering
2019-07-08 15:47:19	MoziM	'reflection is the ability of a process to examine, introspect, and modify its own structure and behavior.[1]'
2019-07-08 15:47:20	metametapod	JordiGH: i am, but there's logic detecting the file name that i'd prefer to have handled by `auto-mode-alist`
2019-07-08 15:47:25	MoziM	according to wikipedia
2019-07-08 15:47:34	wasamasa	reflection is how statically typed languages gain the behavior of dynamically typed languages
2019-07-08 15:47:48	JordiGH	auto-mode-alist isn't very smart. Just an alist of regexes to modes.
2019-07-08 15:48:01	wasamasa	most of the time it's just a runtime dispatch
2019-07-08 15:48:05	JordiGH	If you need greater wisdom, you'll have to inject it elsewhere.
2019-07-08 15:48:06	turbofail	MoziM: that usually implies having run-time data about the source code, not modifying source and recompiling

2019-07-08 15:49:21	turbofail	anyway the distinction between modifying "source" and modifying the "binary" is kind of arbitrary, self-modifying code probably covers both cases regardless

2019-07-08 15:50:05	Sketch	i would think self modifying code would modify the running binary
2019-07-08 15:50:08	metametapod	JordiGH: so this is about as good as it gets?
2019-07-08 15:50:11	JordiGH	You can write compile-time code to list all members of a module, see if they match a regex, and for those that do, write an arbitrary function.

2019-07-08 15:50:29	wasamasa	Sketch: you're forgetting about how a binary is loaded into writable memory
2019-07-08 15:50:31	Sketch	(of course, if it's in a language there is no distinction between source in binary...)
2019-07-08 15:50:44	pakcjo	anyone using evil-mode? I'm trying to learn it, but can't find a good documentation of the keybindings per mode :(
2019-07-08 15:51:03	turbofail	JordiGH: i think you would usually call that metaprogramming if it's happening at compile time
2019-07-08 15:51:18	wasamasa	Sketch: that memory is writable and if your debugger is smart enough, it will yell at you when the representation of the binary it loaded up initially is different from the one in memory
2019-07-08 15:51:19	JordiGH	metametapod: I don't understand what's going on. Why mess with alist at all? Why not make your hook check the buffer's name and if it matches, activate the minor mode?
2019-07-08 15:51:29	wasamasa	Sketch: because that is, sorry about the pun, sketchy behavior

2019-07-09 10:25:22	tinloaf	Is there a way to 'track' a point in elisp? I want to write a function that is given two points. It should first modify contents around the first point, then around the second point. However, the second point of course might be 'out of date' after the first modification, so I would need a way of getting the updated second point.

2019-07-09 10:26:28	tinloaf	Ah, markers track the content they point to, not the point?

2019-07-09 12:25:39	pjb	rumbler31: emacs is installed not only with its executable, but also with shared libraries (that must be compiled for each system), and "resource" files, such as emacs lisp sources and compiled files, and other data files.
2019-07-09 12:26:07	pjb	rumbler31: so you need to make a tarball, and install it on the target system, but you need also to deal with the shared libraries dependencies.
2019-07-09 12:26:35	rumbler31	er...
2019-07-09 12:26:49	rumbler31	how to the maintainers then build emacs for distribution?
2019-07-09 12:27:17	pjb	They build it for a specific system.
2019-07-09 12:27:23	pjb	Distributions.
2019-07-09 12:27:45	pjb	It's better to take the source, and compile and install from the sources.
2019-07-09 12:28:07	pjb	I use something like:    VERSION=26.1 ; wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/emacs-${VERSION}.tar.gz ; tar zxf emacs-${VERSION}.tar.gz ; cd emacs-${VERSION} ; ./configure && make && make install

2019-07-09 12:29:41	pjb	There is a single macOS, and there is a single Windows.  But there are hundreds of diferent linux distributions, with different libraries and library versions.
2019-07-09 12:29:58	wasamasa	look, we can do this the hard way or the easy way
2019-07-09 12:30:41	pjb	Furthermore, Apple and Microsoft take great care to ensure that there's compatibility between different versions of applications and systems (even if they restrict greatly the possiblilities here. You often get unexecutable applications, after system upgrades).
2019-07-09 12:30:42	rumbler31	in this case its ubuntu 16.04 lts all around
2019-07-09 12:30:51	wasamasa	ok, so a debian derivative
2019-07-09 12:31:10	wasamasa	you'd then create a .deb package based on the official one and adjust whatever you're doing differently
2019-07-09 12:31:20	rumbler31	I get that the variety of linux distributions are different and I have my expectations greatly curbed
2019-07-09 12:31:25	pjb	(incf wasamasa)
2019-07-09 12:31:47	wasamasa	then your colleagues would either install the .deb directly or use a package repository containing it

2019-07-09 13:44:06	pjb	Note that CL has a printer and reader for multidimensional arrays, so we know that it is what is called row-major (there's even a array-row-major-index function).
2019-07-09 13:44:30	pjb	And the order is specified, so the mapping with displaced arrays is conforming.
2019-07-09 13:45:26	pjb	But clearly, in maths, we usually index the columns first. So we can easily extract them as ("vertical") vectors.
