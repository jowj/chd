2019-07-09 12:33:00	fireglow	hmm, strage: I needed to change priv/static/index.html -- which I guess is the compiled HTML? idk
2019-07-09 12:33:40	feld	fireglow: what change do you need to make to it?
2019-07-09 12:34:09	fireglow	some favicon stuff in the <head>
2019-07-09 12:36:43	<--	AbedB_ (~AbedBhuty@162.220.164.100) has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2019-07-09 12:38:38	feld	fireglow: is it something we should be doing by default? I know we really need to add the apple-touch-icon stuff because we get a lot of hits for it that end up traversing down the Pleroma API and wasting CPU cycles
2019-07-09 12:39:02	fireglow	feld: I think you answered your own question ;)
2019-07-09 12:39:43	feld	fireglow: correct solution is to fetch the PleromaFE source, make your changes to the index.html there, npm run build, take the contents of dist/* dir and put them into Pleroma's instance/static/ dir (missing by default) which will override the bundled FE
2019-07-09 12:39:54	fireglow	oh my!
2019-07-09 12:40:28	feld	it's heavy handed but you can't just edit index.html because it has references to the js and css files with hashes and they change with each update...
2019-07-09 12:40:38	fireglow	feld: that helps, thank you. I'll set up a mechanism for it
2019-07-09 12:41:12	feld	fireglow: if you could be so kind, build the solution and then open an MR to pleroma/pleroma-fe repo with the fix so everyone gets the apple-touch-icon nonsense solved
2019-07-09 12:41:32	feld	it's on my TODO but I don't know if I'll get to it today :)
2019-07-09 12:41:50	fireglow	feld: I'll give it a try! Let's see how far I get
2019-07-09 12:41:53	feld	ooooh and this also requires backend support
2019-07-09 12:41:58	fireglow	dang
2019-07-09 12:42:03	feld	if it's a new static file
2019-07-09 12:42:10	mgdm	can I remove the default mascots by overriding them somehow in prod.secret.exs, or do I need to hack config.exs first?
2019-07-09 12:42:41	feld	mgdm: never touch config.exs; it's the default/base config which is built upon or overridden by the secret.exs
2019-07-09 12:43:06	feld	fireglow: backend has a list of static files it knows to serve and everything else is assumed to be an API route
2019-07-09 12:43:27	fireglow	feld: I see! wow, okay I'm taking notes now.
2019-07-09 12:43:30	mgdm	feld: I'm attempting to avoid it, but as far as I can tell specifying that as an empty array/map/whatever in prod.secret.exs deep merges them, so I can't remove them
2019-07-09 12:44:03	feld	fireglow: the changes required are in these two files, found by grepping lib/ dir:
2019-07-09 12:44:04	feld	lib/pleroma/web/endpoint.ex:      ~w(index.html robots.txt static finmoji emoji packs sounds images instance sw.js sw-pleroma.js favicon.png schemas doc),
2019-07-09 12:44:04	feld	lib/pleroma/plugs/instance_static.ex:  @only ~w(index.html robots.txt static emoji packs sounds images instance favicon.png sw.js
2019-07-09 12:44:24	feld	mgdm: interesting! cc rinpatch perhaps he can help
2019-07-09 12:44:25	fireglow	feld: roger that
2019-07-09 12:44:48	mgdm	feld: thanks! I could add a new mascot which is just a 1px spacer .png, but that feels like a hack and I'd rather just eliminate it entirely
2019-07-09 12:44:50	feld	fireglow: keep in touch with me on this, i'll help you get the required changes merged
2019-07-09 12:45:59	fireglow	feld: thanks! I will
2019-07-09 12:46:00	feld	first file i linked is the list of static files we allow, second file lists the same bundled files which users can override in instance/static/ dir
2019-07-09 12:46:54	feld	e.g., if you wanted a different favicon but don't want merge conflicts if we ever update our favicon:   cd /path/to/pleroma && mkdir -p instance/static && touch instance/static/favicon.png  <--- this is whatever new favicon you want to serve
2019-07-09 12:47:22	feld	obv touching is just for this example and produces an empty file... :)
2019-07-09 12:50:36	fireglow	hm yes
2019-07-09 13:02:20	fireglow	There is this question of how elaborate we want to be in regards to android/ios support. Taking the package https://realfavicongenerator.net/ spits out, it's quite a lot of files. 9 lines in HTML and 10 static files.

2019-07-10 14:45:57	foggyboi	I haven't looked at this with pleroma recently but elixir just underwent some "soft deprecation" changes to how config gets read
2019-07-10 14:46:18	TheJoYo	1.9.0
2019-07-10 14:46:22	foggyboi	what's the top of your prod secret file look like? is it `use Mix.Config` or is it `import Config`
2019-07-10 14:46:43	TheJoYo	use Mix.Config
2019-07-10 14:46:51	foggyboi	hmmmmmmmmmmmmm
2019-07-10 14:47:30	foggyboi	that should work because they didn't hard deprecate it as far as I know….
2019-07-10 14:51:09	foggyboi	idk if a stack trace will help you it's just missing a module but I've not seen that particular error. If I was feeling particularly grumpy I'd probably swap the use Mix.Config's out for import Config but you really shouldn't have to do that
2019-07-10 14:53:54	TheJoYo	im generating a new one to see if that fixes it

2019-07-15 09:48:28	maybefbi	[08:49:55] as a user
2019-07-15 09:48:28	sheep	[08:50:25] iirc users can't follow relays
2019-07-15 09:48:28	maybefbi	[08:51:09] what do relays do? i am assuming they contact servers on behalf of other servers?
2019-07-15 09:48:28	sheep	[08:51:30] they receive messages from other servers then send them out to servers that follow that relay
2019-07-15 09:48:28	maybefbi	[08:52:42] do relays change the message source server domain names present in the messages?
2019-07-15 09:48:28	sheep	[08:53:00] I don't think so
2019-07-15 09:48:28	maybefbi	[08:53:17] what is the point of relays? why don't servers just connect to each other directly?
2019-07-15 09:48:28	sheep	[08:53:31] because how would they know what the other servers are?
2019-07-15 09:48:28	maybefbi	[08:53:44] oh so relays are like DNS?
2019-07-15 09:48:28	sheep	[08:53:48] not exactly
2019-07-15 09:48:28	sheep	[08:54:22] the point of a relay is so that you can receive messages from other instance without having to have users on your instance find and follow users on that instance or vice versa
2019-07-15 09:48:28	maybefbi	[08:55:31] so where do these relayed messages from other server show up for me as a user? will it be on my server's public timeline?
2019-07-15 09:48:28	sheep	[08:55:32] if an instance follows a well-known relay, then it gets a full federated timeline without having to have users following users on all the instances subscribed to the relay
2019-07-15 09:48:28	sheep	[08:55:58] pleroma FE shows them in "The Whole Known Network"
2019-07-15 09:48:28	maybefbi	[08:56:39] in mastadon it is in federated timeline i bet
2019-07-15 09:48:28	sheep	[08:56:43] yes
2019-07-15 09:48:28	maybefbi	[08:57:41] what is to stop people from making a type of server which modifies the domain names of inside the JSON-LD messages that goes through it so that all messages look like it is coming from itself
2019-07-15 09:48:28	maybefbi	[08:58:09] lets say it maintains an internal map to translate domains back
2019-07-15 09:48:28	maybefbi	[08:58:39] so likes and replies will be "relayed" back to the correct domain
2019-07-15 09:48:28	maybefbi	[08:59:03] is that technically feasible?
2019-07-15 09:48:28	sheep	[08:59:39] servers should check whether the inbox's domain matches the actor's domain, because the inbox is how the replies are received
2019-07-15 09:48:28	maybefbi	[09:01:07] they will match because this malicious relay manipulates them
2019-07-15 09:48:28	sheep	[09:01:34] but then server administrators could block the relay
2019-07-15 09:48:28	maybefbi	[09:03:18] it wont be even a relay in the pleroma relay sense. it will just be a server which manipulates the domain names. so if the server is added to blocked list, the bad actors will just create another server that does this
2019-07-15 09:48:28	sheep	[09:03:58] but if it is a relay, then instance admins would have to actively choose to follow it
2019-07-15 09:48:28	maybefbi	[09:04:41] it wont be. it will be just a server that meddles with domain names in messages.
2019-07-15 09:48:28	maybefbi	[09:04:51] this server will be registered with well known relays
2019-07-15 09:48:28	maybefbi	[09:05:29] and thus blocked servers can be subscribed through this malicious servers
2019-07-15 09:48:28	maybefbi	[09:06:01] the message from blocked servers will show up federated timelines
2019-07-15 09:48:28	sheep	[09:06:47] the relay's admins could block it
2019-07-15 09:48:28	sheep	[09:07:12] but they would have to find out about it somehow
2019-07-15 09:48:28	maybefbi	[09:07:18] yeah true. but currently relay admins are not being targeted by the block activists.
2019-07-15 09:48:28	maybefbi	[09:08:15] im sure there are too many relays to influence and it will be too much work for block activists
2019-07-15 09:48:28	sheep	[09:08:22] I doubt it
2019-07-15 09:48:28	sheep	[09:08:28] they'll just stop following open relays
2019-07-15 09:48:28	sheep	[09:08:38] or stop following relays
2019-07-15 09:48:28	maybefbi	[09:09:21] i hope so too
2019-07-15 09:48:28	maybefbi	[09:09:30] what is the deal with ldsigning?
2019-07-15 09:48:28	maybefbi	[09:09:37] does pleroma have it?
2019-07-15 09:48:28	sheep	[09:13:59] why don';t you read the code and the specs and find out yourself? I'm not helping someone whose goal is to destroy the fediverse
2019-07-15 09:48:28	maybefbi	[09:15:31] if there is a way the will to follow it will be found.
2019-07-15 09:48:28	maybefbi	[09:15:42] \quit
2019-07-15 09:48:28	maybefbi	[09:15:50] quit
2019-07-15 09:48:28	@lanodan	[09:26:46] Honestly if the fediverse could be destroyed by someone having fun with the architecture, then the architecture would need to be redone.
2019-07-15 09:48:28	@lanodan	[09:28:52] Also his idea doesn't work against pleroma because we do not do LD Signing, no idea about the others but I don't think it is _that_ broken of a model, could be interesting to poke it tho.
2019-07-15 09:48:28	@lanodan	[09:30:37] sheep> iirc users can't follow relays // They can, a relay is basically just a bot boosting everything they get
2019-07-15 09:48:28	opal	[11:05:31] i'll help whoever asks first
2019-07-15 09:48:28	opal	[11:18:16] lanodan: like following @relay@instance.example ?
2019-07-15 09:48:28	@lanodan	[11:19:01] or @actor not sure which… it's a bit messy
2019-07-15 09:48:28	sixohsix[m]	[13:57:48] Hello. I'm trying to give the scheduled posts feature in Pleroma a spin, but can't figure it out. Is there a frontend for it?

2019-07-16 13:56:00	bigdumbcat	Hi, If I install from OTP release on debian 10 (or master branch the non-OTP release way) I keep getting "ERROR 42P07 (duplicate_table) relation "users_email_index" already exists" followed by some other things. I just tried to install by OTP release on debian 9 yesterday and that worked fine, I think? Can I fix something from this stage? It's after running pleroma_ctl migrate.

2019-07-16 16:40:27	tallship	I installed pleroma following this guide to the letter: https://docs.pleroma.social/otp_en.html - but had to look elsewhere on how to add the first steps of adding an initial (admin) user. 'which mix' returns nothing on Debian 9.9 arch=amd64 and I've tried the following command to no avail:
2019-07-16 16:40:34	Nepfag	Yeah it's a weird folder structure
2019-07-16 16:41:05	Nepfag	tallship, you don't need an admin user, just register normally
2019-07-16 16:41:28	tallship	 su pleroma -s $SHELL -lc "
2019-07-16 16:41:28	tallship	MIX_ENV=prod mix pleroma.user new myusername myemail@sld.tld --admin
2019-07-16 16:41:28	tallship	"
2019-07-16 16:41:28	tallship	 - to which I get the response: -su: line 1: mix: command not found
2019-07-16 16:41:41	Nepfag	On the web interface
2019-07-16 16:41:53	Nepfag	Like just register like a normal user
2019-07-16 16:42:10	ivesen	you missed this bit:
2019-07-16 16:42:10	ivesen	https://docs.pleroma.social/otp_en.html#running-mix-tasks
2019-07-16 16:44:55	pabloweb32	So, anybody knows where to find relay urls for instance follow ?
2019-07-16 16:45:10	tallship	Also, I'm not sure, since it appears that the only config file used now is config.exs istead of prod.secret.exs. Is that correct? And how do I make sure it's running  in prod mode?
2019-07-16 16:46:37	ivesen	tallship: that should be fine with otp releases
2019-07-16 16:47:41	tallship	ivesen: Ah.. oic :) I did see that when skimming the docs early on and completely missed it, thinking it was something to get  back to later.  Thank you for that. It's not federating yet but I'll look into that in a bit, and I still have to setup email handler first for a relay.

2019-07-16 17:36:01	JK_na	I did a bit of digging and found the commit to add the pleroma_ctl update code.. the detect_branch() function reads the version and branch from "$RELEASE_ROOT"/releases/start_erl.data)".. what should the content of the start_erl.data file look like for master 1.0.1 (or indeed dev)?  Mine is '10.3.5.2 1.0.1' and apparently the function isn't able to deduce whether this is master or dev..

2019-07-19 10:44:38	opal	when would i want rum indices then
2019-07-19 10:44:58	opal	anime.website searches and pulling up profiles is so slow and inconsistent
2019-07-19 10:45:01	opal	lot of requests time out
2019-07-19 11:23:00	@kaniini	rum indices only help with search
2019-07-19 11:23:26	@kaniini	but i think something is more fundamentally broken
2019-07-19 11:23:29	@kaniini	with search
2019-07-19 11:25:12	rin[m]	dunno about status search, but user search is really weird. it likes to time out when there is a domain part of the username and the results are inaccurate
2019-07-19 11:25:48	@kaniini	i'll look into it after finishing the lockdown stuff
2019-07-19 11:27:27	opal	ah
2019-07-19 11:27:46	opal	my personal instance seems to navigate everything just fine
2019-07-19 11:28:08	opal	i can search users (havent tried statuses cus mastofe is weird on private instances, but i'd like to see full search in pleromafe anyway)
2019-07-19 11:28:48	@kaniini	(current status of lockdown stuff: develop can interop with mastodon's "secure mode", now i am working on capability mapping + enforcement)
2019-07-19 11:30:17	opal	what's mastodon's secure mode, is the ostatus removal
2019-07-19 11:30:27	opal	i accidentally a word there
2019-07-19 11:30:31	rin[m]	opal: there is status search in pleroma-fe develop btw
2019-07-19 11:30:53	opal	cool
2019-07-19 11:31:17	opal	i forget, is node required to build fe
2019-07-19 11:31:25	rin[m]	yeah
2019-07-19 11:31:41	rin[m]	when mastodon's secure mode is enabled public posts require to sign fetches with http signatures as well
2019-07-19 11:34:08	rin[m]	kaniini: can it actually be done with httpsigs or are you just preparing the IR for easier OCAP integration in the future?
2019-07-19 11:35:37	@kaniini	rin[m]: as i've said, this httpsigs stuff is to... stabilize the patient (the fediverse) so he isn't bleeding out on the operating table (users running away because of our new additions)
2019-07-19 11:36:20	@kaniini	it's like... TARP
2019-07-19 11:36:34	@kaniini	we're swallowing this with a shit-eating grin on our face
2019-07-19 11:36:50	@kaniini	because, it is what needs to be done
2019-07-19 11:37:13	@kaniini	OCAP is the real fix, but the httpsigs lockdown is "good enough for now"
2019-07-19 11:38:41	@kaniini	i hope that makes my position clear, from both an architectural point of view as well as overall goal
2019-07-19 11:38:52	@kaniini	everything i am doing is "OCAP ready"
2019-07-19 11:40:32	opal	>public posts require to sign fetches
2019-07-19 11:40:37	opal	what if i just... go to someone's instance
2019-07-19 11:40:42	opal	with a web browser
2019-07-19 11:40:49	opal	what does this "security" do against that
2019-07-19 11:41:34	@kaniini	yes opal we are all aware of that loophole
2019-07-19 11:41:45	opal	i wasnt being a smartass, i was legitimately asking
2019-07-19 11:41:54	opal	sorry if i came across otherwise
2019-07-19 11:42:01	@kaniini	well in mastodon, it lets you view the posts
2019-07-19 11:42:06	@kaniini	in pleroma, you can already lock that down.
2019-07-19 11:42:14	opal	i mean on my personal instance i have it marked private so im not worried
2019-07-19 11:42:28	opal	just wondering masto's rationale for introducing such a feature that doesnt even work lol
2019-07-19 11:42:29	opal	thats all
2019-07-19 11:42:41	@kaniini	because it's like TARP.
2019-07-19 11:42:49	@kaniini	and Mastodon is... Bear Stearns
2019-07-19 11:42:51	opal	if i were to write something it would have no / very limited web access
2019-07-19 11:43:13	@kaniini	i would say Lehman but they failed before we got to TARP AFAIK
2019-07-19 11:43:32	opal	"very limited" as in generating pages for conversations themselves, no interlinking, no discovery
2019-07-19 11:43:46	opal	all that functionality would be accessible only with api
2019-07-19 11:43:56	opal	and there you can have proper auth
2019-07-19 11:44:00	@kaniini	yeah
2019-07-19 11:44:08	@kaniini	and pleroma can be configured to work this way already
2019-07-19 11:44:18	opal	i still wanna write an impl but who knows when thatll be
2019-07-19 11:44:22	opal	i hate to be all talk but
2019-07-19 11:44:23	opal	yeah
2019-07-19 11:44:39	opal	other things i need to be doing before starting on something new
2019-07-19 11:44:44	@kaniini	the problem is, pleroma lets you lock down the web access all day long, but it does not let you lock down federation
2019-07-19 11:44:51	@kaniini	with secure mode, mastodon has the opposite problem ;)
2019-07-19 11:45:06	opal	so pleroma implementing secure mode would let interested people address both sides
2019-07-19 11:45:13	@kaniini	yes
2019-07-19 11:45:22	opal	i'll def use it on my personal instance
2019-07-19 11:45:29	opal	ive been thinking to myself ostatus is dead for a while
2019-07-19 11:45:35	opal	duplicate code for all the rest of us
2019-07-19 11:45:37	@kaniini	the final destination (done incrementally) is secure mode enabled by default in enforcing mode with a very limited set of granted capabilities to anonymous web users
2019-07-19 11:45:55	opal	i hate to tell ostatus / gnusocial people "hey yeah your software isnt good enough, too bad" but well
2019-07-19 11:45:58	opal	their software isnt good enough
2019-07-19 11:46:04	@kaniini	we can't do that quite yet though
2019-07-19 11:46:05	opal	people like moonman know this fucking firsthand
2019-07-19 11:46:14	opal	its just... bad
2019-07-19 11:46:14	opal	lol
2019-07-19 11:46:30	@kaniini	so the plan is basically
2019-07-19 11:46:31	opal	i feel like gnusocial users at this point are a cult
2019-07-19 11:46:48	@kaniini	Pleroma 2.0 has the fundamentals for secure mode, but only the 'safe' defaults are flipped on
2019-07-19 11:46:55	@kaniini	Pleroma 3.0 finishes the transition
2019-07-19 11:47:06	@kaniini	Pleroma 4.0 drops http signatures entirely.
2019-07-19 11:47:10	@kaniini	that's the dream anyway.
2019-07-19 11:47:44	opal	personally im tired of seeing so much junk indexed on google from fedi
2019-07-19 11:47:48	opal	thats what it is, junk
2019-07-19 11:47:59	opal	lot of repeat search results cus search engines dont know how to specially treat fedi
2019-07-19 11:48:32	opal	what worked on twitter wont work here
2019-07-19 11:48:42	@kaniini	my plan is to have a framework similar to MRF that looks at a request
2019-07-19 11:48:45	opal	twitter could handle the search engine indexing because one page = one convo
2019-07-19 11:48:58	@kaniini	and decides what capabilities should be bound to that request
2019-07-19 11:49:21	opal	im going more and more off on a tangent here but this is a reason i want to try domain-specific searching, i really need to configure searx some more
2019-07-19 11:49:25	@kaniini	and then if a bearcap is invoked, it bypasses all of this and uses the capabilities sealed into the bearcap
2019-07-19 11:49:58	opal	general-purpose search was useful back when websites were static and decoupled
2019-07-19 11:50:05	opal	doesnt fit the model of the modern web though

2019-07-19 11:58:11	rin[m]	kaniini: what 'safe' defaults exactly? iirc no one but pleroma and mastodon even sign fetches yet
2019-07-19 11:58:44	@kaniini	rin[m]: for 1.1/2.0 that means fetches are signed, but enforcement is not enabled by default
2019-07-19 11:59:20	rin[m]	ah, alright
2019-07-19 11:59:27	@kaniini	rin[m]: in other words, security features gradually get flipped on as they become less disruptive
2019-07-19 11:59:44	@kaniini	(and those who want them today can flip them on early)
2019-07-19 12:01:12	opal	this entire thing is politically-loaded, again primarily by the gnusocial crowd

2019-07-19 12:02:24	opal	we have a lot of people who are against dragnet surveillance and shit like that, these additional features make it more difficult for adversarial presences like that
2019-07-19 12:03:03	opal	its hard telling people "i know my stuff is public and out there, but i want to slow its spread"
2019-07-19 12:03:55	opal	having the internet become one single dumping ground isnt really something anyone should aspire to
2019-07-19 12:05:59	rin[m]	signed fetches have other uses though, e.g tracking who exactly got the activity so we can send out deletes without either having undeleted copies left or creating a shitton of federation traffic
2019-07-19 12:06:12	opal	yes
2019-07-19 12:08:20	@kaniini	rin[m]: yes, and ultimately OCAP will reduce the overhead of that by 99%
2019-07-19 12:08:21	@kaniini	;)
2019-07-19 12:15:29	rin[m]	having more robust deletes without a noticeable performance drop is like number one reason I am interested in authenticated fetch adoption

2019-07-19 16:09:08	@kaniini	if you're on dev mode, you should get lots of debug output
2019-07-19 16:10:37	Rhonda	hmm, [info] REFUSED CONNECTION TO Pleroma.Web.UserSocket in 300µs
2019-07-19 16:16:59	@kaniini	that doesn't mean anything
2019-07-19 16:17:11	@kaniini	that just means your client couldn't log into the chatbox (which it can't since it has no user)
2019-07-19 16:20:28	Rhonda	When I call it in journalctl --follow I only see the sudo command for running the pleroma.user new, but nothing else.  How can I get to more debug output, because it somehow looks like that information never reaches the service?
2019-07-19 16:30:05	@kaniini	how are you running the mix command exactly

2019-07-24 12:47:50	is0bel[m]	it looks like my new pleroma instance isn't connected to the whole fediverse? like, in the frontend i only see the local timeline. why is this?
2019-07-24 12:54:29	cybercafe	is0bel[m]: your instance isn't federating
2019-07-24 12:54:47	cybercafe	I recently set up a new OTP release and it is also not federating :-(
2019-07-24 12:55:01	cybercafe	it's able to receive notifications from remote servers but not receive timelines
2019-07-24 12:56:17	is0bel[m]	how do we fix that?
2019-07-24 13:01:01	shibayashi[m]	is0bel: You need to follow other accounts on other servers for the federated timeline to fill up. Looks like you’re currently only following one account on your own instance.
2019-07-24 13:03:11	is0bel[m]	ok, cool
2019-07-24 13:07:28	is0bel[m]	shouldn't stuff from other instances show up in the whole known network, though?
2019-07-24 13:07:30	cybercafe	i've tried that with mine
2019-07-24 13:07:41	cybercafe	i followed a number of remote users on multiple remote servers
2019-07-24 13:07:46	cybercafe	no dice :~ (
2019-07-24 13:08:24	ng0	can take a while
2019-07-24 13:15:51	shibayashi[m]	The way federation work is, that remote servers push new content to followers of their accounts. So if there is no user on your server, that follows a particular user on a remote user, your server will not get any content from that user. The exception is, that if someone you follow reacts to something from that user, by replying, favouriting, etc. then you will get the original post too.
2019-07-24 13:15:52	shibayashi[m]	So over time the federated timeline will fill up, based on how you and your users are interacting with the Fediverse and how many remote accounts they are following. It’s a representation of your social graph.
2019-07-24 13:15:53	shibayashi[m]	If you want to quickly fill it up with random content, you can follow relays. Following a Pleroma relay is basically like subscribing to their local timeline. Following a Mastodon relay is a bit different I think. It’s more like “Everything from my server is sent to the relay and to its subscribers and my server is getting every public posts from all those subscribers”.
2019-07-24 13:16:20	is0bel[m]	oh! that's a very good explanation, thank you
2019-07-24 13:17:28	shibayashi[m]	cybercafe: Do you get new posts from the remote users you followed in your personal timeline?
2019-07-24 13:23:36	shibayashi[m]	is0bel: Let’s fix your HTTP -> HTTPS redirect problem. Have you changed anything besides the `server_name` in the first server block compared to the example config? https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/installation/pleroma.nginx
2019-07-24 13:29:31	cybercafe	shibayashi[m]: no
2019-07-24 13:29:50	cybercafe	shibayashi[m]: when a remote user follows, favorites, replies, direct messages, those come through, but not posts
2019-07-24 13:30:08	cybercafe	it's been up for nearly 12 hours :~(
2019-07-24 13:30:20	shibayashi[m]	is0bel: Looks like federation is working. You followed a remote user and your federated timeline also already shows a different users because they replied to a post from that person
2019-07-24 13:31:20	shibayashi[m]	cybercafe: That’s really weird
2019-07-24 13:31:51	cybercafe	i'll try following 10 users on 10 instances and go for a smoke :P
2019-07-24 13:31:56	shibayashi[m]	Do you mind posting your instance name?
2019-07-24 13:32:04	cybercafe	shibayashi[m]: if it helps i'm using the OTP release amd64
2019-07-24 13:32:18	cybercafe	modified NGINX and related, have HTTPS working with a valid cert

2019-07-24 13:33:11	shibayashi[m]	cybercafe: I’m also running the OTP release but I migrated from a source-based one and didn’t start a new one.

2019-07-26 13:18:56	LivingPharaoh	I dunno anything about Raspberry. I'm all surface-level code. PHP and HTML. I'm guessing this is above my paygrade?

2019-07-26 13:26:45	LivingPharaoh	I mean social networks for geographical communities, and by queer alphabets I'm pretty sure Pleroma is Slavic/Russian. Did I get that wrong?
