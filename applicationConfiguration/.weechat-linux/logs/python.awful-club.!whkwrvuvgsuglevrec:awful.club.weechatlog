2019-07-28 02:32:54	mrled	(it's now btw, all birds are dinosaurs)
2019-07-28 02:33:07	mrled	(have u ever looked at a grackle i mean really LOOKED)
2019-07-28 02:33:09	&jowj	micah its $currentyear, all years prior are dino years
2019-07-28 02:33:12	&jowj	grackles are horrifying
2019-07-28 02:33:23	&jowj	I have read amazing things about net-canons employed in like taylor texas
2019-07-28 02:33:26	&jowj	to try and catch them
2019-07-28 02:33:40	mrled	The I’m sorry what
2019-07-28 02:34:06	&jowj	ok here's one of my fav stories
2019-07-28 02:34:07	&jowj	https://www.kut.org/post/time-ut-austin-waged-war-grackles
2019-07-28 02:34:36	&jowj	they played ping pong with grackles!
2019-07-28 02:34:41	&jowj	because it wasn't legal to kill them!!!
2019-07-28 02:36:34	mrled	It is ILLEGAL TO KILL THEM? That’s insane, they are everywhere
2019-07-28 02:37:03	mrled	That’s awesome
2019-07-28 02:37:34	&jowj	here's the city of denton using cannons lol
2019-07-28 02:37:36	&jowj	https://texaschlforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=5609
2019-07-28 02:37:45	&jowj	(there's a linked article that died but they c&p the text)
2019-07-28 02:38:24	&jowj	here's another article about hot hair cannons v grackles
2019-07-28 02:38:25	&jowj	https://www.statesman.com/news/20160828/cannon-lasers-await-migrating-grackles-that-stay-too-long
2019-07-28 02:38:33	&jowj	its one of my favorite bits of texas lore
2019-07-28 02:38:49	mrled	That’s crazy
2019-07-28 02:38:52	mrled	Ive never heard of this
2019-07-28 03:23:37	mrled	That CHL forum has for some reason permabanned my home IP address
2019-07-28 03:23:40	mrled	So I cannot see it
2019-07-28 03:23:48	&jowj	ahahaha
2019-07-28 03:23:59	&jowj	well, the headline of the following aritcle "cannon, lasers awai grackles"
2019-07-28 03:24:03	&jowj	gives u an idea
2019-07-28 03:52:44	&jowj	HAH cooooool
2019-07-28 03:52:56	&jowj	i finally got the matrix plugin to weechat working, so now i'm typing from this ridiculous thing
2019-07-28 03:53:24	&jowj	https://matrix.awful.club:443/_matrix/media/r0/download/awful.club/LGfHCAsySNlIAmmOcVsIooXD/image.png
2019-07-28 03:53:33	mrled	Haha nice
2019-07-28 03:53:37	mrled	I thought you were using that this whole time
2019-07-28 03:53:48	&jowj	no! encryption wasn't working for a very long time, i'm using riot mostly
2019-07-28 03:54:13	&jowj	i'll probably use riot mainly for a while until/unless i fully commit to weechat and use its relay system
2019-07-28 03:54:35	&jowj	but WOO this took me forever
2019-07-28 03:55:44	mrled	Ahhh I see
2019-07-28 03:55:49	mrled	Now we have no encryption problem in here
2019-07-28 03:55:50	mrled	Perfect
2019-07-28 03:55:55	&jowj	ya lol
2019-07-28 03:56:00	&jowj	but it supports encyrption now!!
2019-07-28 03:56:04	&jowj	through the use of libolm
2019-07-28 03:56:14	&jowj	which is an implementation of the open whisper double rachet protocol
2019-07-28 03:56:20	mrled	Oh, cool
2019-07-28 03:56:22	&jowj	which is actually pretty rad
2019-07-28 03:56:24	&jowj	its in go
2019-07-28 03:56:26	&jowj	iirc
2019-07-28 03:58:18	&jowj	oh weird there's even supposed to be typing notifications in here
2019-07-28 04:02:23	&jowj	and test
2019-07-28 04:02:30	&jowj	fascinating
2019-07-28 04:02:32	&jowj	i am into this
2019-07-28 04:02:40	mrled	How much work was it to set up
2019-07-28 04:03:04	&jowj	tbh once i moved over to weechat compiled with python3 support, none
2019-07-28 04:03:16	&jowj	but it was figuring out that the python 2.7 support promised by the plugin was fake that took so long
2019-07-28 04:03:15	mrled	Lol I mean all of weechat
2019-07-28 04:03:26	&jowj	oh
2019-07-28 04:03:27	mrled	I remember old irc crap like bouncers and stuff being a huge pain
2019-07-28 04:03:39	&jowj	weechat is pretty werid? but i'm still using a bouncer for my irc channels
2019-07-28 04:03:57	mrled	Where do you even go in irc
2019-07-28 04:04:01	&jowj	i'm eschewing the weechat server > n number of weechat relayclients model because of a gaping security hole
2019-07-28 04:04:25	&jowj	(they treating the relay > server relationship as trusted, and weechat lets you run arbitrary commands, so if anyone owns your server they can own all of your clients, at once!!)
2019-07-28 04:04:49	&jowj	i hang out in like 2 channels on OFTC, and then get support for a few projects i'm working on in fleanode.
2019-07-28 04:05:23	&jowj	oftc has crimehole, made by twitter friends, and freenode has like pleroma + an opensource browser i want to like but so far can't lol
2019-07-28 04:05:51	mrled	Fleanode lol
2019-07-28 04:06:05	&jowj	weechat also connects to slack in a mediocre fashion; images are a pain (but still viewable) and text is first rate, so its nice to run it on my garbage laptops that can't actually run a ton of electron at once
2019-07-28 04:06:26	mrled	Man, I don’t think I’d ever trust a non-big name browser
2019-07-28 04:06:30	mrled	The security threats on the web are insane
2019-07-28 04:06:35	&jowj	oh no yeah its horrible
2019-07-28 04:06:35	mrled	Maybe if JavaScript were disabled
2019-07-28 04:07:09	&jowj	its, are you ready to be disappointed in me, supposed to be "emacs for the browser" where its written in lisp, lisp is the config language, and its entirely keyboard driven
2019-07-28 04:07:14	&jowj	its like embedded webkit iirc
2019-07-28 04:07:25	&jowj	i just wanna use it for browsing the web, not for doing anything
2019-07-28 04:07:40	&jowj	specifically like 3-5 sites that are JUST comments / basic image viewing
2019-07-28 04:07:46	&jowj	like reddit, hackernews or whatever.
2019-07-28 04:08:07	&jowj	i've found a cool idea but bad implementation of the same keyboard driven thing, on firefox
2019-07-28 04:08:29	&jowj	called..bebop
2019-07-28 04:09:03	&jowj	https://matrix.awful.club:443/_matrix/media/r0/download/awful.club/DQtQbsSnWeAPlXssVihBIpSx/image.png
2019-07-28 04:09:25	&jowj	that looks like that; you activate that with a hotkey, type like ":l git" and it will fuzzy match the possible links that are on page
2019-07-28 04:09:32	mrled	Yuckkkkkkk lol
2019-07-28 04:09:34	&jowj	then, hit enter to be taken to the most 'likely' link
2019-07-28 04:09:40	&jowj	or shift enter for the one below that
2019-07-28 04:09:47	&jowj	yeah the ui is garbo, emacs people are stupid dorks about ui
2019-07-28 04:09:56	&jowj	but i really like not having to mouse around when i'm trolling through links on google.
2019-07-28 04:10:04	mrled	The ff thing I get, but why LISP of all things lol
2019-07-28 04:10:09	&jowj	yeah WHO knows
2019-07-28 04:10:12	&jowj	that's not a good idea
2019-07-28 04:10:37	mrled	I used conkeror for a while. It had a link hinting thing. It seemed like a good idea, but ultimately I found it slower than just, clicking
2019-07-28 04:10:56	mrled	It was based on mozilla xulrunner
2019-07-28 04:11:01	&jowj	i never used conkeror but know of it
2019-07-28 04:11:23	&jowj	this thing fuzzy matches based on the title text, the url, and i think the seo text
2019-07-28 04:11:30	&jowj	so you don't really have to be all that exact
2019-07-28 04:11:59	&jowj	also it doesn't work on github for i guess the same reason pinboard's bookmarklet doesn't
2019-07-28 04:12:02	&jowj	which is AGGREVATING
2019-07-28 04:12:15	mrled	I dunno why mozilla won’t fix that
2019-07-28 04:12:57	&jowj	its so jarring!
2019-07-28 04:18:07	&jowj	i have to go to bed
2019-07-28 04:18:08	&jowj	its boring
2019-07-28 04:19:23	&jowj	also @mrled write a rpely so i can test something lol
2019-07-28 04:19:32	&jowj	ugh, ok, @ing doesn't work well on weechat
2019-07-28 04:19:34	&jowj	mrled:
2019-07-28 04:19:38	&jowj	yeah, like not at all
