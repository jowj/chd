2019-07-10 13:10:55	franklyrosalind	idk
2019-07-10 13:17:41	zws	naw, zoom installed a local listener that would never be uninstalled even when you uninstalled the zoom app, so that zoom.us could remove friction in using links.
2019-07-10 13:18:32	zws	and they bypassed the CORS restriction by send an image of specific dimensions to the home zoom servers! like "[1, 0] == update thing, [1, 1] means reinstall" etc
2019-07-10 13:18:44	zws	fuckers (and also huge lmao) 
2019-07-10 13:18:53	zws	in using /zoom/ links
2019-07-10 13:19:18	zws	they refused to use the regular URI handler schema on macs because of some jankiness with safari which i am not terribly familiar with, i think it was basically adding 1-2 clicks of friction to the process
2019-07-10 13:19:44	franklyrosalind	actually that owns
2019-07-10 13:19:53	franklyrosalind	EXTREMELY cursed engineering

2019-07-10 13:20:59	zws	you could just embed specific js on a page and auto boot everyone into a specific meeting id (omg)
2019-07-10 13:21:13	franklyrosalind	REALLY

2019-07-10 13:22:00	zws	so people would click on it while reading the article, then you just see a bunch of nerds in a channel going 'whoaaaaaaaaaaa'

2019-07-18 10:02:50	zws	good morning my friends
2019-07-18 10:03:33	zws	last night i fucked around with the firefox color scheme creator thing that they have? i /sorta/ like it but wow shit looks ugly once you start customizing tab placement :\
2019-07-18 10:04:21	zws	it doesn't know what to do with the treestyle tab config i guess? its weird
2019-07-18 10:04:47	zws	any of the sidebars, really, bookmarks looks hilarious with the skin. totally unaffected
2019-07-18 10:22:04	dutchie	hmm, maybe I should invest some time into firefox theming
2019-07-18 10:22:18	dutchie	although i already waste way too much of my life on ricing up my pc
2019-07-18 10:23:34	zws	its limited themeing, but its a lot more than you can do with other browsers ime?
2019-07-18 10:24:05	zws	i don't really spend any time in apps that aren't: $terminal, emacs, firefox :# so i don't have to do much besides those three application configurations
2019-07-18 10:24:16	dutchie	heh, same
2019-07-18 10:24:29	dutchie	I just gave up on "let's try using a text editor which isn't emacs"
2019-07-18 10:24:36	riking	If it lets you change the layout at all, is more than chrome
2019-07-18 10:25:01	riking	I only use solid color themes in chrome tho
2019-07-18 10:25:11	dutchie	not sure how to feel that the main thing to go back to it was everything else i tried sucking at email and todo more than mu4e/org
2019-07-18 10:25:32	dutchie	used kakoune for just long enough to fuck up my muscle memory though :(
2019-07-18 10:25:33	zws	the layout isn't changable with the color.firefox.com theming, but there are 3rd party apps that let you do it (treestyle tab, etc) if you're willing to fuck with userChrome.css
2019-07-18 10:25:57	zws	i have never got into using mu4e, but yeah i can't find anythign that competes with org-mode
2019-07-18 10:26:22	zws	its just, the best. stock, it met a ton of my needs. and its also the only system that'll let me extend it however i want!
2019-07-18 10:26:47	dutchie	yep! although i need to get back into the habit of actually looking at it
2019-07-18 10:27:07	dutchie	also having enough willpower to do the things i'm supposed to do, but that's not the todo list's fault
2019-07-18 10:36:39	zws	haha
2019-07-18 10:36:42	zws	right exactly
2019-07-18 10:37:02	zws	ios has a /really good/ mobile org app in beorg
2019-07-18 10:37:17	zws	i have heard good things about orgzly?  but haven't tried it. 
2019-07-18 10:37:22	zws	for android, i mean
2019-07-18 10:37:36	zws	that mobile app helps me a shitload in terms of capturing shit when i'm not at my computer.
2019-07-18 10:38:05	dutchie	orgzly is ok, though I don't think I've ever actually added anything to org with it
2019-07-18 10:38:21	dutchie	mainly I use it for reading recipes on my phone in the kitchen
2019-07-18 10:52:45	caurinus	Google keep, Google docs
2019-07-18 10:53:03	caurinus	keep is actually not good but it syncs so w/e
2019-07-18 11:15:56	zws	beorg is really good for adding and basic todo manipulation.
2019-07-18 11:16:17	riking	+1 on 'keep is not good'
2019-07-18 11:16:17	zws	it also has a built in scheme repl for scripting if you want to be MObile First or whatever
2019-07-18 11:16:31	riking	i'm now using habitca for my TODOs
2019-07-18 11:16:50	zws	that is not something i've ever used because I am a Desktop First person and also i don't want to learn a different lisp when I already have to know elisp for my config language ;;

2019-07-25 14:43:38	zws	i'm curious - i use macOS for work and linux at home. is anyone familiar with a single tool like hammerspoon that works on linux?
2019-07-25 14:44:00	zws	none of the functionality is unique, but it usually requires using several Other Tools rather than a single one with a single config language
2019-07-25 14:59:51	ignatz	Never heard of this thing, looks cool.
2019-07-25 15:00:55	kalium_puceon	I think linuxes might be too varied in how they implement this stuff to make One Universal Tool, perhaps
2019-07-25 15:23:39	Ash	zws: macro-ish stuff is so bad on linux :( it's a bummer
2019-07-25 15:24:05	zws	ignatz: its really nice tbh, i'm very pleasantly surprised
2019-07-25 15:24:17	zws	kalium_puceon: yeah i think that's a reasonable take
2019-07-25 15:24:17	Ash	no karabiner/autohotkey/etc type things that work as well either
2019-07-25 15:24:40	Ash	the random linux tools don't add up to what's available on macOS/windows unfortunately
2019-07-25 15:24:56	zws	:| using it at work makes me want it real bad at home haha
2019-07-25 15:25:09	zws	i'm gonna Have To Compromise i suppose
2019-07-25 15:25:18	Ash	time 2 mac
2019-07-25 15:25:19	Ash	hehe
2019-07-25 15:25:28	Ash	but yeah sigh
2019-07-25 15:27:00	ignatz	just integrate it with Gnome!~!!!!!
2019-07-25 15:27:05	Ash	right???
2019-07-25 16:27:02	caurinus	i just had some ambien thoughts but without involving any actual ambien
2019-07-25 16:41:49	atonal440	I think we all have ambien thoughts as our brains disconnect but mostly we forget them
2019-07-25 16:44:38	Ash	sshhhhh ambien walrus not now

2019-07-26 10:31:24	caurinus	dutchie: not bad
2019-07-26 10:32:12	caurinus	hey y'all i'd like to announce that my character, Nat the changeling rogue arcane trickster, was killed by a fireball, and no one shed a tear
2019-07-26 10:32:20	caurinus	her body was tossed into the ocean
2019-07-26 10:32:34	dutchie	rip
2019-07-26 10:32:39	dutchie	i haven't played any rpg in ages
2019-07-26 10:33:17	caurinus	5e is god damn fun
2019-07-26 10:33:43	dutchie	there was some rumblings of organisation happening among my friends
2019-07-26 10:33:48	caurinus	i tried 3.5e about 8 years back, it had too many numbers
2019-07-26 10:34:01	dutchie	& there is a group that meets every wednesday evening just round the corner from where i live
2019-07-26 10:35:40	caurinus	anyway new character is going to be Gwendolyn Crisptreacle, cleric who specializes in undeath
2019-07-26 10:37:32	dutchie	sounds fun
2019-07-26 10:37:32	caurinus	i'm going to see if i can revivify my old character because she had a lot of regret for her bullshit+shenanigans. and failing that, raise her as an undead servant
2019-07-26 10:37:46	caurinus	just to fuck with everyone's brains
2019-07-26 10:40:01	caurinus	so hopefully Miss Crisptreacle lands into the fray in time to give Nat a chance to spend a few months to years atoning for being, as an angry gnome called her, a "wildcard", making amends with everyone she's inconvenienced
2019-07-26 10:41:02	caurinus	bearing in mind Nat is about 70 and will probably have a heart attack about 1 hour into her second chance
2019-07-26 10:42:34	dutchie	nice
2019-07-26 10:43:38	caurinus	in case no one has noticed, d&d has become kind of my "one thing that gets me out of the house consistently and without fail"
2019-07-26 10:43:55	caurinus	(assuming i'm conscious)
2019-07-26 10:44:01	dutchie	it's good to have something like that
2019-07-26 10:44:09	dutchie	choir was that for a long time for me
2019-07-26 10:46:27	caurinus	for me it was jazz, bearing in mind that was a high school class so it's not like i could choose to *not* go
2019-07-26 10:50:18	caurinus	playing an instrument is a great one though, it's very of physical, not in an exercise/exertion sense but like, if you're in the groove you just play the song with your whole body
2019-07-26 10:50:28	caurinus	so you can get emotional from it
2019-07-26 10:50:28	dutchie	yeah same with singing
2019-07-26 10:51:21	caurinus	and once you know how to play music, how it works, it takes on a new meaning, it's a different experience.
2019-07-26 10:52:34	caurinus	brubeck quartet's "time out" was the turning point. it just blasted my brain
2019-07-26 10:54:33	caurinus	i legit wasn't the same once i picked up jazz, even though i was a bad musician, didn't practice, when i did play it was something else in my life
2019-07-26 10:54:46	caurinus	it centered me.
2019-07-26 10:57:23	caurinus	i think i should get back into it soon.

2019-07-27 23:16:02	zws	oh that is cool!
2019-07-27 23:16:24	riking	you just need to short the two pins & it'll boot off USB or SD card
2019-07-27 23:18:43	riking	i think that this is the best kind of "exploit" btw... nobody's even trying to break the software except pirates, the homebrew people are happy with just getting to use the hardware
2019-07-27 23:19:03	zws	this seems very cool
2019-07-27 23:19:13	zws	its too bad it only applies to a specific gen of switch
2019-07-27 23:19:19	zws	i wonder if my brother has that version or not!
2019-07-27 23:19:37	riking	i have the early one
2019-07-27 23:20:24	riking	wait, from the comments it sounds like it's something else??
2019-07-27 23:20:28	zws	i think my brother has the early one, he got it for his partner soon after the switch came out?
