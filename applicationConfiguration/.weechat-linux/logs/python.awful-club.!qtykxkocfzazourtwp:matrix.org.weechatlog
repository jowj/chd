2019-07-28 01:01:14	&matthew	hm, looks like it got lost on a gist
2019-07-28 01:01:19	&matthew	i don't know of a reason not to MSC it
2019-07-28 01:01:44	@travis	It's in a draft state while we figure out the scope of it
2019-07-28 01:03:00	@travis	the gist isn't meant for the public yet as it's mostly a scratchpad of ideas rather than a solution
2019-07-28 01:03:50	yan	wasn't there a google docs document describing telegram-alike buttons/callbacks?
2019-07-28 01:04:14	yan	I feel like the core concept is the same
2019-07-28 01:04:52	@travis	There is https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1485 however I have Thoughts on it and why it's insufficient
2019-07-28 01:09:03	@travis	I guess it should probably be a real MSC... the Riot branches are already out there, just not merged/PRd

2019-07-28 04:11:53	minji	Is websocket support high priority? I imagine using websockets for syncing rooms alone would noticeably improve the performance and perceived responsiveness of Riot. Plus it would be much more friendly for Android roms without GCM. The GitHub issue hasn't been touched in a while

2019-07-28 05:16:43	auscompgeek	A proof-of-concept implementation would be good I guess.
2019-07-28 05:21:13	ptman	I believe sse or websockets would replace long polling, not gcm

2019-07-28 09:02:39	C0rn3j	I keep getting kicked from freenode groups and I don't understand how to fix it - Reason: IRC error on #archlinux: err_needreggednick
2019-07-28 09:03:06	C0rn3j	it seems it's trying to use "C0rn3j[m]" but when I try to login to my account on freenode and do "/nick C0rn3j[m]" I get an error that the nick is already in use
2019-07-28 09:03:11	Nickli	it says right there, you need to register a nick on freenode
2019-07-28 09:04:19	C0rn3j	Yeah but I can't because it is in use already. And I don't get how to merge the IRC Riot acc(?) and my usual IRC acc in that case
2019-07-28 09:04:24	Nickli	seems to me you'r already using C0rn3j
2019-07-28 09:05:10	C0rn3j	So what should I do?
2019-07-28 09:07:50	Nickli	i don't know
2019-07-28 09:08:24	Nickli	sure you registered as C0rn3j exactly and without [m]
2019-07-28 09:08:35	Nickli	and not*
2019-07-28 09:09:33	C0rn3j	when I send "INFO C0rn3j" to nickserv- Nicks      : C0rn3j C0rn3j[m] C0rn3j_
2019-07-28 09:10:21	C0rn3j	huh it works now

2019-07-28 10:08:51	deepc0re	how does consensus work in matrix?
2019-07-28 10:15:03	heftig	I'm trying to moderate a room; I have maximum permissions (100), settings look ok but I only get permission errors
2019-07-28 10:15:03		why?
2019-07-28 10:18:47	heftig	riot says i have user level 100, synapse says i have user level 0; wtf
2019-07-28 10:19:09	swedneck:privacytools.io	sounds like a state reset
2019-07-28 10:20:43	swedneck:privacytools.io	i presume it's an old room, and not one you just made?
2019-07-28 10:25:26	heftig	yeah, old room
2019-07-28 10:25:47	heftig	i just moved my permissions from an old user @matrix.org to a new(er) user @archlinux.org
2019-07-28 10:26:02	heftig	but now matrix.org believes the move happened and archlinux.org believes it did not
2019-07-28 10:26:11	heftig	so i'm stuck
2019-07-28 10:40:07	thenamelesswonderer	does running your own synapse reveal your ip to everyone or is there a cloak feature sort of like in IRC?
2019-07-28 10:42:20	Nickli	how would anyone be able to connect to the homeserver otherwise?

2019-07-28 10:44:39		> or is there a cloak feature sort of like in IRC?
2019-07-28 10:44:39		it reveals the IP of your server, not any users
2019-07-28 10:45:54	thenamelesswonderer	Right and anyone can see it by clicking on a user's name?
2019-07-28 10:47:04	Nickli	most stuff is relayed via the server so not the individual user IP is revealed to other servers
2019-07-28 10:47:47	heftig	so what do I do now? the homeservers disagree on the power levels
2019-07-28 10:48:30	Nickli	heftig: your server is software up to date?
2019-07-28 10:48:41	heftig	yes
2019-07-28 10:57:44	maralorn	TheNamelessWonderer: Anyone can figure the homeserver IP out, by doing a DNS request (or looking into the .well-known) of the domain part of your users id. But I donâ€˜t know of any client which would integrate that into the ui. I donâ€˜t think anyone needs that feature.

2019-07-28 10:59:10		state resets suck, if you can get PL 100 again i think the best action is to upgrade the room
2019-07-28 10:59:31	swedneck:privacytools.io	if you can't get PL 100 again you'll have to make a new room and move people there
2019-07-28 11:00:12	heftig	I also tried removing the event which lowered the matrix.org user's power level
2019-07-28 11:00:20	heftig	it was removed but the power level didn't change
2019-07-28 11:52:23	&matthew	it should be impossible to entirely lose power due to state resets (unless users explicitly relinquished power)
2019-07-28 11:52:55	&matthew	so find a user who has ops and upgrade the room to escape the mess
2019-07-28 12:32:06	heftig	Matthew: there's nobody else left
2019-07-28 12:32:17	heftig	the only other admin is a deactivated matrix.org account
2019-07-28 12:34:41	heftig	Matthew: i'm not even sure a "state reset" is what happened, since I didn't get unexpectedly rejoined
2019-07-28 12:35:18	heftig	but now the homeservers are in disagreement; archlinux.org says @heftig:matrix.org has 100 and @heftig:archlinux.org has 0
2019-07-28 12:35:24	heftig	matrix.org says the opposite is the case
