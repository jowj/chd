2019-06-13 01:33:42	&jowj	we should make plans to hang out this weekend
2019-06-24 01:28:40	&jowj	bros i finally did it and also here's a blog
2019-06-24 01:28:41	&jowj	https://me.jowj.net/projects/2019/06/23/pynit.html
2019-06-27 15:00:29	ndled	Speaking of your new place
2019-06-27 15:00:37	ndled	What we doing today?
2019-06-27 15:02:41	&jowj	the new place isn't mine until the first, i'm just picking up keys
2019-06-27 15:02:57	&jowj	so....your house?
2019-06-27 15:03:00	&jowj	I can probably be there around 7, I have to go pick up the  keys around 6:15/6:30
2019-07-02 01:09:58	mrled	jowj: this could be cool https://github.com/hometown-fork/hometown
2019-07-02 01:21:09	&jowj	oh that’s cool
2019-07-02 01:21:14	&jowj	i wonder if it’s easier to self host than pleroma
2019-07-02 01:21:28	&jowj	pleroma sucks to dockerize i haven’t got it to work yet
2019-07-02 01:27:23	mrled	sounds like it's the same as hosting mastodon itself
2019-07-02 01:29:04	&jowj	yeah
2019-07-02 01:29:17	&jowj	i also wonder if it has the resource hog problem that mastodon does.
2019-07-02 01:29:39	mrled	i'm sure it does
2019-07-02 01:29:41	mrled	it just sounds like feature difference
2019-07-02 01:29:48	mrled	the local only posting thing sounds cool tho
2019-07-02 01:36:20	&jowj	ya
2019-07-02 01:36:32	&jowj	local only posting exists for pleroma too
2019-07-02 01:36:39	&jowj	although i like that this is specifically about that
2019-07-02 01:37:03	mrled	seems like a good default, or even forced option depending on the community
2019-07-18 16:45:35	&jowj	hey ndled mrled y'all have plans for tonight? MIcah i can't remember if tonight is a you guys have your appointment night or not :)
2019-07-18 16:46:33	mrled	Afraid so - I can’t hang out tonight
2019-07-18 16:46:52	&jowj	No worries man therapy ain't nothing to apologize for :)
2019-07-18 16:48:38	mrled	Oh I’m not sorry
2019-07-18 16:48:58	&jowj	I misread afraid so!
2019-07-18 16:49:03	&jowj	 * I misread "afraid so"!
2019-07-18 16:49:16	&jowj	oh hey it actually /edits/ the previous line now
