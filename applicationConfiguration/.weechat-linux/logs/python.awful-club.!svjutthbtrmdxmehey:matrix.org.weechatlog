2019-07-25 18:35:29	vin	Yeah I was wondering if it would be better to set up my own appservice but the hosted one is very convenient

2019-07-26 20:02:37	alexgleason	I'm having some trouble setting up the Slack bridge on riot.im. I clicked "Event bridging", the popup came up, I clicked "Accept" and closed the tab, then the widget modal just reset and didn't list my rooms.
2019-07-26 20:04:41	alexgleason	It says:
2019-07-26 20:04:41		> Integration Successful!
2019-07-26 20:04:41		> Your Matrix-Slack account is now correctly authorized.
2019-07-26 20:04:41		But then I close the tab and the modal in the Riot window resets
2019-07-27 01:01:32	kingoftheconnors	I had that problem too. It was a huge bother and I had to take the long way around (setting up the actual appservice) because I couldn't find a solution. Does anyone here know why it doesn't work?

2019-07-27 19:46:50		Yeah, I saw :(. Regrettably I think we need to restart the bridge to fix it

2019-07-27 20:00:15	swedneck:privacytools.io	well that is very strange behaviour for the gitter bridge
2019-07-27 20:00:50	swedneck:privacytools.io	it seems to recognize that there's double bridging going on, but not really do anything about it
2019-07-27 20:06:10	tulir	what should it do about it?
2019-07-27 20:07:20	swedneck	either refuse to bridge and scream at you, do bridge but scream at you periodically or at least once when initiating the bridge, or make matrix ghosts for the matrix users in the other room
2019-07-27 20:09:55	tulir	well the second option isn't very nice and the third option would be hacky
2019-07-27 20:10:29	tulir	the first option is probably the correct one, but the matrix.org bridges are silly
2019-07-28 01:12:56	kingoftheconnors	I've got another problem with my Slack Bridge (Sorry! At this point I'm just posting question around the clock). It's about sending images from Slack to Matrix.
2019-07-28 01:13:13	kingoftheconnors	It doesn't work. It works from Matrix to Slack, but not the other way.
