2019-07-23 19:45:15	amarquez80	Hi,  Is the server configured to use postgres by default?
2019-07-23 19:46:55	aaron	Yes
2019-07-23 19:47:43	amarquez80	Ok in which table are the users stored?
2019-07-23 19:49:00	aaron	Not near a computer but I think it is just called users. #synapse:matrix.org will be more helpful since this applies to any install of Synapse.
2019-07-23 19:49:41	amarquez80	ok thank you Aaron
2019-07-23 19:57:04	amarquez80	its very rare. I have registered 3 users but the table still empty
2019-07-23 20:05:11	amarquez80	public.users
2019-07-23 20:17:22	amarquez80	thanks
2019-07-23 20:20:22	amarquez80	I find the solution, now Is there a way to connect a local application to the docker postgres instance?
2019-07-23 20:21:45	amarquez80	I would like to do a GUI app in order to manage the users
2019-07-23 21:11:00	&slavi	amarquez80: you can tell the postgres container to expose its port. I don't have a computer now, so I can't tell you exactly how. Feel free to read the defaults.yml file in the matrix-postgres file though.

2019-07-28 02:25:34	munfred	Hi, I'm trying to understand how the file /matrix/nginx-proxy/conf.d/matrix-synapse.conf gets configured from the playbooks.
2019-07-28 02:25:34		I'm trying to adapt an existing role to setup the mautrix-hangouts bridge, and to do so I need to include the following snippet into that config file:
2019-07-28 02:25:34		                                                        
2019-07-28 02:25:34		  location /login {                                     
2019-07-28 02:25:34		        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;               
2019-07-28 02:25:34		        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;  
2019-07-28 02:25:34		      }                                                 
2019-07-28 02:25:34		                                                        
2019-07-28 02:25:34		                                                        
2019-07-28 02:25:34		Thanks!
2019-07-28 02:29:28	aaron	Are you trying to contribute mautrix-hangouts integration with this project or just trying to set it up for youself without ansible?
2019-07-28 02:34:07	munfred	First I am trying to set it up for myself on an instance where I used the ansible playbook to setup the facebook, whatsapp and telegram bridges. Then I will try to turn that on a playbook, and if it works I'd like to contribute it back. I'm working with @linus:matrix.neurotecherslan.party on this project
2019-07-28 02:39:33	aaron	If you just want to set it up for youself then you probably want to do https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/configuring-playbook-own-webserver.md and then just add that bit
