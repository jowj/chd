2019-07-15 12:08:36	@sarnold	ToriGaming: I have thought about hashcash before for registration but figured it wouldn't solve the problems that the google recaptcha solves: (a) botnets have more orless infinite free time and can mint whatever (b) real human users will have *harder* time using it than recaptcha, for the most part. yeah debian and derivative users can just apt-get install hashcash ; hashcash -m moo -b40 or whatever, but
2019-07-15 12:08:42	@sarnold	if you don't have a super-easy way to get hashcash installed, it's way harder than clicking a few things
2019-07-15 12:09:16	@sarnold	ToriGaming: granted recaptcha isn't the most accessible tool, but we've verified people by hand before

2019-07-15 17:18:19	ToriGaming	sarnold: The main reason for this HashCash thing has nothing to do with normal registration users, they already have options. It's all about the TorBrowser and its associated users so its a very specialized solution for a smaller group of users, minority if you will. I don't know if Google re-captcha is compatible with TorBrowser users. If you mean normal users not using TorBrowser yeah sure. My topic is giving a solution to
2019-07-15 17:18:19	ToriGaming	TorBrowser users in comparison to giving them 0 solutions.
2019-07-15 17:23:16	ToriGaming	now if a botnet actually is going to create a thousand accounts on hackint, I won't be able to tell if they're gonna succeed or not(and for what purpose they'd do such a thing). For all I know somebody could already have done it, but I have no proof.
2019-07-15 17:23:39	@sarnold	hackint?
2019-07-15 17:24:02	ToriGaming	Yes, hackint and their automated registration process https://hashcash.hackint.org/
2019-07-15 17:24:17	@sarnold	ToriGaming: hmm, the complaint I see from torbrowser users suggests to me that they not only can do recaptcha, but are extremely annoyed at having to do so for half the websites in the world..
2019-07-15 17:24:39	ToriGaming	btw they told me in chat they are not "mining any coins" but if anybody chooses to believe that I'm ok. I'm not gonna attempt to convince anybody to stop believing in their convictions.

2019-07-15 17:27:28	ToriGaming	sarnold: the game becomes especially better when the recaptcha tells me: "you passed the test" and then goes completely Alzheimers on me and asks me for a re-captcha as if I didn't do it before
2019-07-15 17:28:35	ToriGaming	but that's not what the discussion was about. It started with me asking what OFTC thinks of https://hashcash.hackint.org/ and you explained in a very good way why OFTC won't go that way, and I've happily accepted that answer. It sounds like a reasonable explanation.
2019-07-15 17:29:03	@Unit193	ToriGaming: You were talking to dwfreed, not sarnold.
2019-07-15 17:29:17	@sarnold	Unit193: ToriGaming talked to both of us :) I was the one who didn't immediately hate the idea
2019-07-15 17:29:45	@sarnold	Unit193: it just doesn't solve the biggest problem we have with the spambots -- trying to show a *human* is driving the registration requests
2019-07-15 17:29:48	@Unit193	Ah, the larger discussion was the one I followed.
2019-07-15 17:32:48	@Unit193	sarnold: Sometimes I have a hard time with recaptchas, maybe I too am not human.
2019-07-15 17:33:27	@sarnold	Unit193: it's always hard finding out, but the truth will make you a stronger  .. err, well, not *human*, mind you .. it'll make you stronger. whatever you are.
2019-07-15 17:40:43	ToriGaming	Unit193: yes, that's historically correct.

2019-07-16 10:20:22	ToriGaming	Oh, I solved the captcha for 35xp, but now it asks me for a 2nd captcha. Is this part of the standard oftc protocol? Anyway I think we have amnesia oftc again for a 2nd time, if not.(reCAPTCHA are TorBrowser user's fav amnesia machine, and that's why we love em so much)

2019-07-18 14:11:13	@Myon	the oftc support mail address is getting tor questions every few days
2019-07-18 14:12:17	@Myon	somehow the tor website doesn't have useful support info, so people desparately click on the "oftc" link there
2019-07-18 14:13:02	ahf	Myon: yikes, that doesn't sound good
2019-07-18 14:13:13	ahf	Myon: gonna forward that
2019-07-18 14:14:01	@Myon	pastly already did, but it wouldn't hurt if someone picked it up and changed it
2019-07-18 14:14:02	@sarnold	please do, it's a pretty poor experience for tor users
2019-07-18 14:14:42	@Myon	I actually had a checkout of the website git open a few years ago but then couldn't figure out what to write
2019-07-18 14:14:46	ahf	https://www.torproject.org/contact/ our contact info seems useful though, but maybe the OFTC link shouldn't be clickable or email should be before 'IRC'
2019-07-18 14:14:52	@Myon	some tor person would be better
2019-07-18 14:14:56	ahf	we just got a new website though :-)
2019-07-18 14:15:34	@Myon	maybe that's already enough
2019-07-18 14:15:57	ahf	https://2019.www.torproject.org/about/contact.html.en was the old contact page
2019-07-18 14:15:59	@Myon	or maybe that just means people will now come to #oftc instead of support@oftc.net :-X
2019-07-18 14:16:13	ahf	the new one seems to link to oftc webchat and the old one linked to oftc main page

2019-07-25 14:02:28	irl__	is there any compelling benefits to using the cert auth?
2019-07-25 14:04:26	@sarnold	if services is offline when you connect, you'll be automatically identified when services returns; which might be more convenient if you've got enforce turned on
2019-07-25 14:04:47	maxy	Hi, I'm currently at DebConf19, and after a talk with other Debinites from latinoamerica we would like to use the channel #debian-latam, sadly its currently without an OP and unregistered.
2019-07-25 14:04:57	irl__	that is compelling enough
2019-07-25 14:04:59	irl__	thanks
2019-07-25 14:05:20	maxy	Is there anything I could do to register it?
2019-07-25 14:06:59	irl__	maxy: some debian people are also oftc staff and i would guess some of them are there
2019-07-25 14:07:49	irl__	maxy: look for anyone on this list https://wiki.debian.org/IRC/Operators
2019-07-25 14:09:04	maxy	irl__: I know Ganneff is an oftc admin, but he is not around. Well, maybe he gets this ping.
2019-07-25 14:10:51	irl__	there's also nothing stopping you using the channel before you get op there
2019-07-25 14:13:30	maxy	Right, I just wanted to change the topic, but sure.
2019-07-25 14:13:46	maxy	Thanks!
2019-07-25 14:13:51	[itchyjunk]	Is it already registered?
2019-07-25 14:13:59	[itchyjunk]	Can't you register it through chanserv?
2019-07-25 14:14:14	irl__	i believe you need to be op to register a channel
2019-07-25 14:14:53	[itchyjunk]	But it does show maxy is an op. :x
