2019-07-02 00:44:01	&alphapapa	seems to work fine when I upload it from Emacs
2019-07-02 00:45:16	&alphapapa	to investigate further we'd have to look into the debug log, which would probably be better done through a GitHub issue than in this room.  If you're interested, please open an issue there and I'll try to help you figure out what's going on.

2019-07-02 02:43:24		You'll need to consult the Matrix protocol docs.  Matrix uses open HTTP connections, waiting for server responses.
2019-07-02 02:49:16	mparker	Was just looking at those. Thks again.

2019-07-03 05:38:38	&alphapapa	Thomas: How is cl-matrix coming?  Are you still working on it?
2019-07-03 07:04:20	thomaslewis	I haven’t done much with it in a while. It’s mostly complete (no olm support yet) and can be used for a client. Some of the classes added at the end of the class file were created as I was working on Nephele. The library’s name is Cirriform. The name change was due to gnuxie having an earlier project with that name.
2019-07-03 07:05:03	thomaslewis	I’ll probably get back to it sometime after my current project of attempting an Exherbo install without systemd.
2019-07-03 07:10:06	gnu_ponut	My lib is still being worked on but there's gonna be a few changes in the future
