2019-07-27 16:16:52	inceptor	Oops. Wrong room i think. Sorry.
2019-07-27 16:47:38	dreamerchris	👍 yes win+ .
2019-07-27 18:30:26	theblackhierophant	Trolling party added a bunch of addresses for the room that are now not removable. Error reads "Error removing alias: There was an error removing that alias. It may no longer exist or a temporary error occurred."
2019-07-27 18:30:29	theblackhierophant	How to fix?
2019-07-27 18:33:42	tulir	theBlackHierophant: you can't remove aliases added by others, but if you're on the same server, you can hide them from the room state with /devtools: Explore Room State -> m.room.aliases -> matrix.org -> Edit -> remove all the spam -> Send
2019-07-27 18:34:17	tulir	server admins can remove aliases added by others, so also report them to the admin of the server they were on
2019-07-27 18:34:50	theblackhierophant	Thanks
2019-07-27 21:06:09	autismsandwich	I can no longer see the 'Public' and 'Room Directory' options when creating a room. I am assuming these are still set to off by default?

2019-07-28 01:26:41	thosgood	how do you update riot? can you do it in the app or do you need to redownload the latest release directly?
2019-07-28 01:27:55	thosgood	oh, i guess it's just the web app but wrapped up, so no updates need on a computer, right?
2019-07-28 01:33:29	aaron	You’ll get a banner across the top when there is an update. If you are using the website it will just update when you refresh the page.
2019-07-28 02:32:22	qurqar	Any plans for being able to search in encrypted rooms?
2019-07-28 02:35:49	aaron	Yes of course (and it does seem to be fairly close, see https://matrix.to/#/!kiEtuVPPUonkeDVCTQ:matrix.org/$1560349600310307XegwR:matrix.org?via=matrix.org&via=raim.ist&via=ponies.im for a sneak peak)

2019-07-28 02:42:44	qurqar	Aaron:  had no idea, thanks, sounds like an interesting solution
2019-07-28 03:16:37	qurqar	Aaron:  2 questions. Will this how up as  a new device? I would want that if possible because I do not want to get my contacts to go through verifications again. 2 Will this mess up audio/video 1to1 chat?
2019-07-28 03:20:25	aaron	I assume no to both but I haven't tried it yet
2019-07-28 03:21:58	qurqar	ok thanks
2019-07-28 06:27:44	hypd	Newbie question: I've set up a couple of encrypted rooms, and all devices (for all users) in those rooms are verified. This includes a mobile device that I use to access the room via the official Riot.im app for Android.
2019-07-28 06:27:44		Now, due to numerous reasons, I'd like to re-install the OS on my mobile device, which means re-installying the Riot.im app, too. However, is there a way to backup my current Riot.im app, and restore it after re-installing the OS so that it does not show up as a new device meaning I don't have to go through the laborious process of asking everyone in the room to re-verifiy it? Thank you.
2019-07-28 06:36:16	kunsi	i'm not aware of any backup features
2019-07-28 06:40:26	hypd	There are Android apps for backing up app data prior to a system/OS re-install. Would they work for backing up the Riot.im app so that upon restoration, it would continue as the same device without re-verification?
2019-07-28 06:40:51	hypd	Such as Titanium Backup or oandbackup.
2019-07-28 06:40:59	hypd	Would that work?
2019-07-28 06:41:47	kunsi	never tried

2019-07-28 10:11:22	dreamerchris	I guess theoreticly in my opinion this should not be allowed cause of security but I would love there to be a way like a one time use key that the only purpose of it would be to migrate to a new setup so if you got one device like you for e. G. That you want to reinstall os/riot, with the use of this key it would continue to be encrypted and verified as the same device or even a migration to ones' new device

2019-07-28 10:12:23	tulir	cross-signing is coming and sounds like it would solve your use case
2019-07-28 10:12:46	tulir	it won't be the same device, but it'll make verification basically transparent to everyone else who has verified your cross signing identity
2019-07-28 10:12:54	tulir	and with the existing key sharing, you'll be able to decrypt old messages
2019-07-28 10:13:16	dreamerchris	Notice there the "one time use key" so it is logical and be a migration
2019-07-28 10:13:49	dreamerchris	Great tulir that would work nice too
