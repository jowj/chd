2019-07-28 06:35:44		my guess is that a lot of it is caused by plastics. we wear it, we drink from it, we eat from it, we touch plastics daily. there were studies that showed that most plastics release estrogenic compounds.
2019-07-28 06:44:37	@rszibele	there is of course a lot more that could be causing testosterone levels to drop. e.g. diet, pesticides, pollutants, other chemical exposure.
2019-07-28 06:45:50	yorick	I don't think it's just hormones causing the feeling though don't they get treated with more hormones and hormone blockers to match the expected levels in the sex identified with?
2019-07-28 06:45:51	@rszibele	 * there is of course a lot more that could be causing testosterone levels to drop. e.g. diet, pesticides, pollutants, exposure to other chemicals.
2019-07-28 06:46:17	yorick	And yeah I don't think it's just plastic there have been transgendered people far longer than there has been plastic
2019-07-28 06:47:31	yorick	Or at least third gender roles in I think Asian countries mostly

2019-07-28 06:48:57		yes, that's after the fact they know they are of the other gender. this doesn't however take into consideration testosterone levels while growing up for example. give a man with low testosterone some testosterone via. injections and he'll be a completely different person.

2019-07-28 06:49:54		not saying there never were, but the occurances today seem a lot higher, which also correlates with lower testosterone and sperm viability in first world countries.
2019-07-28 06:52:15	@rszibele	I would be interested in a study on testosterone levels of men who identify as women (pre hormone treatment).
2019-07-28 06:54:51	@rszibele	I suppose such a study would be politically incorrect though and therefore wouldn't get funding, but I haven't searched much.
2019-07-28 06:56:01	yorick	I don't know I hear a lot of "but nowadays there's a lot more of x" and I'm not sure how much of that is believable
2019-07-28 06:57:03	yorick	With closeted feelings and societies biased against certain groups et cetera et cetera it just seems it's too difficult to tell how much frequency has changed and I never know what statistic to trust

2019-07-28 06:59:13	@rszibele	yorick: yeah, it's hard to figure that out, but a study on men's testosterone levels who identify as women would shine some light on the issue.

2019-07-28 09:08:11	&tauoverpi	note the guitar is for creating sound effects
2019-07-28 09:08:30	weedloser	you're too brilliant for the game industry
2019-07-28 09:08:57	yorick	Ocarina, pan flute are cheap and easy to learn
2019-07-28 09:09:04	yorick	Normal flute not so much
2019-07-28 09:09:38	yorick	Ooh how about percussion
2019-07-28 09:10:14	yorick	Bongo boy
2019-07-28 09:11:52	&tauoverpi	harder to carry
2019-07-28 09:14:16	&tauoverpi	it needs to be practical
2019-07-28 09:20:00	weedloser	slap your gf's ass
2019-07-28 09:20:00		perfect percussion
2019-07-28 09:21:23	&tauoverpi	requires bringing an extra mouth to feed just for an instrument
2019-07-28 09:21:27	&tauoverpi	not practical
2019-07-28 09:21:33	yorick	Whistling
2019-07-28 09:21:38	&tauoverpi	that I have
2019-07-28 09:22:30	yorick	Singing?

2019-07-28 09:22:58	ojoon	Can you hear some screamo metal in the distance if you're insane enough?
2019-07-28 09:23:04	&tauoverpi	no
2019-07-28 09:23:10	ojoon	Booooring.
2019-07-28 09:23:22	&tauoverpi	but you can hear the voices of those you killed asking you why
2019-07-28 09:23:43	&tauoverpi	or some of their screams of pain, etc
2019-07-28 09:24:00	&tauoverpi	no background music
2019-07-28 09:24:05	&tauoverpi	it ruins things
2019-07-28 09:24:34	&tauoverpi	(might change my mind but it is how it is for now)
2019-07-28 09:25:08	&tauoverpi	background music didn't work so well before which is why (waiting for cat pic)
2019-07-28 09:25:11	yorick	Ambient sounds though right
2019-07-28 09:25:16	yorick	Rain snow bird etc
2019-07-28 09:25:17	&tauoverpi	of course
2019-07-28 09:25:43	yorick	The clap of your asscheeks when you're dummy thicc?

2019-07-28 09:26:32	weedloser	if you hadn't been in stallman communist cult you would have no problem feeding your percussion

2019-07-28 10:26:31	&tauoverpi	guix isn't as nice when dealing with linked repos that use in-tree building instead of something sane
2019-07-28 10:26:42	&tauoverpi	well, it's still better than debian packaging
2019-07-28 10:27:26	&tauoverpi	I might have missed a part which would make all of this much easier
2019-07-28 10:28:01	&tauoverpi	it's building now so I don't care anymore, just want a 3D CAD program that's not blender

2019-07-28 10:29:28	&tauoverpi	I spoke too soon
2019-07-28 10:29:36	whirlpool.spectrum	whats wrong with blender?
2019-07-28 10:30:09	&tauoverpi	I'd have to learn it properly
2019-07-28 10:30:26	&tauoverpi	solvespace might be fun to use since it uses constraint solving to model
2019-07-28 10:30:33	&tauoverpi	https://0x0.st/zfbQ.scm
2019-07-28 10:30:44	&tauoverpi	the package (it's a mess and still needs fixes)
2019-07-28 10:32:31	whirlpool.spectrum	what electric guitar are you gonna get?
2019-07-28 10:32:51	justin	my motives are not wanting to be attracted to trans people
2019-07-28 10:33:19	&tauoverpi	not really sure, would have to ask a guy I know about it
2019-07-28 10:33:42	&tauoverpi	justin #off-topic:feneas.org <-
2019-07-28 10:33:43	whirlpool.spectrum	well I can help you
2019-07-28 10:35:34	 *	&tauoverpi doesn't know much about electric guitars
2019-07-28 10:36:10	whirlpool.spectrum	we all have to start somewhere so whats your budget?
2019-07-28 10:38:40	&tauoverpi	Currently 200 euro for it but can go higher. It's mainly for generating sound effects rather than playing.
2019-07-28 10:39:46	whirlpool.spectrum	curious what kind of sound effects you exactly need for the electric guitar
2019-07-28 10:42:18	&tauoverpi	everything involving reverb and ambient noise
2019-07-28 10:42:31	&tauoverpi	plus I'd like to learn the guitar
2019-07-28 10:42:38	&tauoverpi	properly for once
2019-07-28 10:43:27	whirlpool.spectrum	do you enjoy playing it though?
2019-07-28 10:43:56	&tauoverpi	did last time I had one
2019-07-28 10:43:54	whirlpool.spectrum	thats what determines whether or not you fully will be commited to it
2019-07-28 10:45:09	&tauoverpi	plus picking it up at least once a day with the intention to play will eventually feed back into motivation
2019-07-28 10:46:14	whirlpool.spectrum	sounds good, but when you stopped playing did that fire inside to go further with it burn out?
2019-07-28 10:47:54	&tauoverpi	not really, I gave it away at the time as I couldn't bring it with me. Only real reason why I stopped
2019-07-28 10:48:21	whirlpool.spectrum	sounds like you still have the motivation for it
2019-07-28 10:48:58	whirlpool.spectrum	I'd recommend acoustic for newcomers, but since you sounds like you've got experience, you might want to pick up electric
2019-07-28 10:49:31	whirlpool.spectrum	used guitars are good but be careful and make educated purchases and bring along a friend who knows guitars
2019-07-28 10:50:28	&tauoverpi	Will when I visit london again, friend works within the music industry so should be a reliable source
2019-07-28 10:50:52	whirlpool.spectrum	though make sure you truly love the guitar
2019-07-28 10:50:58	whirlpool.spectrum	the wood grain
2019-07-28 10:50:59	whirlpool.spectrum	everything
2019-07-28 10:51:02	whirlpool.spectrum	the feel
2019-07-28 10:51:07	whirlpool.spectrum	the sound
2019-07-28 10:51:19	whirlpool.spectrum	you don't want to end up selling the guitar because you don't like the sound or feel of it
2019-07-28 10:54:56	&tauoverpi	haven't played enough guitars to complain about the feel of it yet
2019-07-28 10:55:15	&tauoverpi	so I should be good on that one
2019-07-28 10:55:33	whirlpool.spectrum	would recommend you just go into a store and pick one you like the look of and try it out
2019-07-28 10:56:52	&tauoverpi	https://0x0.st/zfbL.txt
2019-07-28 10:56:56	&tauoverpi	ffffffffffffff
2019-07-28 10:57:59	joeri_poeri	Learning the guitar is def worth it, do you have an electric one or an acoustic one?
2019-07-28 10:58:25	&tauoverpi	I'll be getting another electric

2019-07-28 11:07:55	whirlpool.spectrum	as soon as I saw it was discounted at a guitar store I knew I had to pick it up
2019-07-28 11:08:38	whirlpool.spectrum	it was either an epiphone les paul or a fender stratocaster
2019-07-28 11:08:56	whirlpool.spectrum	I tried both but honestly was still having trouble deciding
