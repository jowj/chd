However, since the working directory still contains the package source code, that seems to take precedence over my installed wheel. Anybody have experience with this?

2019-07-09 14:20:52	ikanobori	Heh?
2019-07-09 14:21:02	JordiGH	I can use gdb to grab that gunicorn process but I can't get past the gunicorn code.
2019-07-09 14:21:08	JordiGH	And it's a worker process.
2019-07-09 14:21:18	JordiGH	If I stop it too long with gdb, the supervisor kills my debugged process.

2019-07-09 14:21:45	ikanobori	As in, what does it do.
2019-07-09 14:21:53	tourjin	hmm. there is python-pip installed. but there is no python-pip command. only pip command.
2019-07-09 14:22:02	JordiGH	The actual bug is that one of my Django widgets sometimes renders as "None" instead of the actual HTML ("<select >...</select>").
2019-07-09 14:22:14	ikanobori	That sounds... unlikely to be gunicorn related?
2019-07-09 14:22:21	ikanobori	How did you come to the conclusion that it's that?
2019-07-09 14:22:21	JordiGH	It's process-related.
2019-07-09 14:22:26	TML	tourjin: your distro names the Python pacakge "thing" as "python-thing"
2019-07-09 14:22:26	JordiGH	Only happens in a certain process
2019-07-09 14:22:35	JordiGH	I can't repro it otherwise.
2019-07-09 14:22:46	TML	tourjin: so what your distro vendor calls "python-pip", we call "pip"

2019-07-09 14:23:17	JordiGH	If I pay attention to which gunicorn process is serving the page, only one process produces None instead of the HTML.
2019-07-09 14:23:29	ikanobori	Ok so; how do you normally run your Django?

2019-07-09 14:24:26	ikanobori	Ok so, I'd say it's more likely that there's some sort of race condition with something and because gunicorn runs multiple processes there's no multiple processes using the same backend.
2019-07-09 14:24:33	JordiGH	And it doesn't always happen with gunicorn; some gunicorn process gets poisoned somehow and starts serving the wrong thing.
2019-07-09 14:24:34	ikanobori	And then somehow some state gets silly.
2019-07-09 14:24:45	ikanobori	Because Django's runserver is a single process.

2019-07-09 14:27:35	ikanobori	Ah ok well, then you can easily remove that bit by making gunicorn only start one process and see if it still occurs.

2019-07-09 16:04:02	kapsh	mat001, putting executable things directly in the module scope is generally bad, they will run on every import. Caller importing your module would not expect that change his setting or output something. Scrictly speaking, basicconfig in your case won't change anything when root logger has handlers.
